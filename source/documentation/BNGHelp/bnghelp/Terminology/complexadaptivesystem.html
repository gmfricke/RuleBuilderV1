<p>
A complex adaptive system is a nonlinear system that displays greater behavioral complexity in its whole,
in comparison to its composite pieces.  Each piece may exhibit predictable, simple actions that are simple to
model, yet when combined with all pieces, the model becomes unpredictable and complex.  Biologically based examples
include ant colonies and cells.
