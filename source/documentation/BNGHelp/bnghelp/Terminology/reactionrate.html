<p>
Each <a href="./reactionrule.html" style="text-decoration:none"> reaction rule </a> is associated with a rate law, which applies
to all reactions within the class of reactions defined by the rule.  The reaction rate is assumed to have the form of a rate law for 
an elementary chemical reaction with the appropriate number of reactants, and one must be provided for each direction of a reaction
rule it is used in.

<p>
Within RuleBuilder, after placing either the 
<a href="../Modeling/SoftwareComponents/addforwardproductionoperatormode.html" style="text-decoration:none"> forward production operator </a>
or the <a href="../Modeling/SoftwareComponents/addforwardreverseproductionoperatormode.html" style="text-decoration:none"> forward and reverse production operator </a>
between species on each side of the reaction, the rate(s) are set while in 
<a href="../Modeling/SoftwareComponents/objectmanipulationmode.html" style="text-decoration:none"> object manipulation mode</a>.  Reselecting the arrow will 
bring up a rate dialog box that allows setting of either the forward rate only or forward and backward reaction rates.
