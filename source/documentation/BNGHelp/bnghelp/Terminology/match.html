<p>
An object within the Editor Window can match to a <a href="./pattern.html" style="text-decoration:none"> pattern </a> within its corresponding 
Palette Window.  In other words, a molecule may match a molecular type within the Molecule Template Palette, a grouping of molecules may match a 
template grouping within the Species or Observables Palettes, or a reaction rule may match a template rule within the Reaction Rule Palette.  
Matching corresponds to either an exact match between two object names, or between objects where one is named and the other is a 
<a href="./wildcard.html" style="text-decoration:none"> wildcard</a>.  In either case, matching also connotes structural equivalence between the 
involved objects where said objects may be components, molecules, species or reaction rules.
</p>

<p>
Matching may also occur within component states.  Identically named states for two components will match, as will a named state and a wildcard.
