<p>
A component is a building block of a <a href="./molecule.html" style="text-decoration:none"> molecule</a>.  
Within BioNetGen components are represented graphically as nodes and have two descriptors, name and 
<a href="./state.html" style="text-decoration:none"> state</a>, which denote the relevant physical 
properties.  
</p>

<br>

<p>
Occasionally it is useful to specify the connectivity of a node.  This is done by choosing which node 
symbol from the tool bar when creating components and molecules on the Editor Window.  The open circle 
is used for a node that is unconnected to any other node, while the filled circle is used for a node that 
is connected to a node.  The half-filled circle serves as a wildcard and indicates that the node may be either
connected or unconnected.
</p>

<p>
Components as nodes may be joined to other components in other molecules by adding 
<a href="./edge.html" style="text-decoration:none"> edges </a> between them using the 
<a href="../../Modeling/SoftwareComponents/AddEdgeMode.html" style="text-decoration:none"> add edge mode </a> option.  
</p>

<br>

<p>
Examples of nodes include, a site of post-translational modification in a protein, or phosphorylation 
of a kinase activation loop.
