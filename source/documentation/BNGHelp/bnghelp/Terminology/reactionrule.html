<h1> Reaction Rule </h1>

<br>

<p>
A reaction rule has essentially the same form as a chemical reaction and serves 
as a template to define different individual reactions.  Once defined, reaction rules
serve to form an entire reaction class.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Within a reaction class, reactants undergo a common type of transformation.  All
involved reactants share explicitly specified properties and indeed only chemical
species that share these properties can qualify as reactants in setting up the 
reaction rule.  Unset or unspecified properties within a reaction rule are assumed
not to affect the modeled chemistry of the rule by having no impact on its reaction
rate.  If bench experimental results later show the need for additional property
inclusion, the reaction rules may be modified accordingly.  This simplification
focuses on what is known and allows for automatic evaluation of the reaction rules
in deriving a reaction network.
