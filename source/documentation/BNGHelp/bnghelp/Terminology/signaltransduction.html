<h1> Signal Transduction </h1>

<p>
Signal transduction is a fundamental biological process that occurs primarily on the surface of cells as a reaction to the sensed 
context of biochemical stimuli.  Conversion, or transduction, of proteins at the surface into different proteins directly proceeds 
from whatever protein complexes, enzymes or hormonal signals are present.  Each transduction gives rise to a new signal representing
a new possible signaling pathway.  Slight shifts in content and concentration of biochemical participants can lead to a rich number 
different signaling pathways.

<p>
Modeling of signal transduction must incorporate the molecular component level of detail, along with states of each of the 
involved components, to realistically capture the multitude of protein interactions that can occur.
Computationally this gives rise to a large, complex system in which the number of chemical species in a system depends 
exponentially on the number of interactions in the system.  This can grow to be quite large, even when few interactions are 
involved.  BioNetGen strives to capture every possible resulting interaction that can spontaneously occur during
signal transduction.
