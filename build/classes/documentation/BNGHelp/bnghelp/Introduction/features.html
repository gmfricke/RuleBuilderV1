-->

<ul>
<li> Modeling biochemical systems such as metabolic networks, cell-signaling pathways, and regulatory networks can be done methodically within a logical framework. </li>
<li> The RuleBuilder interface provides the capability to construct a complete graphical set of reaction rules. </li>
<li> An unlimited number of species and reactions can be specified as network starting seeds. </li>
<li> Reaction rules allow specification of how the molecular context of individual components affects reaction rates. </li>
<li> The BioNetGen Engine generates a complete network of chemical species and interactions using initial starting seeds. </li>
<li> Multistate species are allowed. </li>
<li> Input files can be easily modified for new uses through either the RuleBuilder interface, or by direct edit. </li>
<li> Built-in support for time course simulation with standard ODE solvers. </li>
<li> Results of network building and simulation are easily exportable to common analysis package formats. </li>
</ul>
