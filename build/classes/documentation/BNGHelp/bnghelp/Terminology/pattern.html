<h1> Pattern </h1>

<p>
A RuleBuilder pattern serves as a template within each respective Palette Window.  Molecule patterns, registered within the Molecule Template 
Palette Window, form a particular specific molecule type.  Likewise, species patterns, registered within the Species Palette, form a specific 
species type.  The analogy carries further to both observables and reaction rules.  Within each context, registered patterns may then be implicitly 
or explicitly <a href="./match.html" style="text-decoration:none"> matched </a> during creation of more complex objects.  Patterns are the least 
restrictive objects within RuleBuilder in terms of fully specified attributes.  Within the context of molecules, patterns are the subsuming set 
where components &#8838; molecules &#8838; species &#8838; patterns.
