<p>
A reversible reaction is one in which the reaction proceeds in both directions.  Symbolically this is created through
use of a bidirectional arrow within a <a href="./reactionrule.html" style="text-decoration:none"> reaction rule</a>.  In 
the forward direction reactants and the resulting products are on the left and right hand sides of the arrow respectively,
whereas the symmetric sense is true for the backward direction.  For reversible reactions in BioNetGen two rate laws
are required, one for each direction.
