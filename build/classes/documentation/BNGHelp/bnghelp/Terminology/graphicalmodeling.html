<h1> Graphical Modeling </h1>

<br>

<p>
The graphical rule based modeling used in BioNetGen follows a simple representational scheme where each
partition of a graph denotes a single molecule.  Partitions are indicated by boxes surrounding collections
of one or more nodes.  Within a partition, nodes denote components and edges represent bonds between 
components.   Bonds that can form or break during signaling are the only ones that are explicitly drawn.  
</p>

<br>

<p> Node conventions include empty nodes as unbound components, half-filled nodes as components that may
be bound or unbound and filled-nodes as components that are bound.  Node labels give the name of the component,
and, if the component is allowed to have multiple states, state information as well.
