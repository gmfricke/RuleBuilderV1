<p>
A molecule is comprised of multiple <a href="./component.html" style="text-decoration:none"> components</a>.  A molecule may 
have one or more domains, as described by its components, where each may have one or more 
<a href="./state.html" style="text-decoration:none"> states</a>.  Graphically this is represented by a box surrounding a set
of nodes that represent each component of the molecule.  This box then serves as a unit, which
can be named.  Molecules with no set states will display with a red outline, molecules with set 
states will display with a green outline.

<p>
A Fc&#949RI receptor, bivalent IgE ligand, Src family kinase Lyn or protein tyrosine
kinase Syk are all examples of molecules.
