<h1> State </h1>

<br>

<p>
A state is an attribute of a molecular <a href="./component.html" style="text-decoration:none"> component</a>, for example 
attributes such as non-covalent ligation, conformation or covalent modification might be used to describe possible variations 
of a component.  Each of these attributes comprises a single state and may influence the 
<a href="./reactionrate.html" style="text-decoration:none"> rate of a reaction</a>.  Components may have multiple states as well. 
</p>

<br>

<! --
The possible states for each component are implicitly indexed with integer values ranging 
from 0 for the first state to n - 1 for the final state.  Component/state combinations 
may be associated with descriptive names within a BioNetGen input file comment line, but are not 
used to generate the network.  Additionally, the &#8727 symbol within an input file serves as a 
wildcard value for a component's state indicating modeling of all possible states.

<p>
The user assigns states two different ways.  Dragging a molecule over to the Molecule Types Palette
will trigger a prompt to set node states.  States may be continue to be added until the Done option
is selected.  Additionally a molecule already present in the Molecule Types Palette may be edited directly
to add, modify or delete states as needed.  Again, once the use is satisfied, the Done option should
be selected.  States may be set for each node of a molecule. 
</p>

<br>

<p> 
A molecule with at least one state is valid as indicated in the Molecule Types Palette with a green outline.  
Unfinished molecules with no defined states retain their red color until the minimum of one state has been set.
