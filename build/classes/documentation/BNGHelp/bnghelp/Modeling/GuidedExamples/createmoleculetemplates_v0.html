<h1> Create Molecule Types </h1>

Each molecule type is created individually on the Editor Window using these modes(buttons):
<ul>
<li> unbound component <img src="../../../images/unbound_component.gif" width=2% height=2% border=1> </li>
<li> container component <img src="../../../images/container.gif" width=2% height=2% border=1>  </li>
<li> object manipulation mode <img src="../../../images/ObjectManipulationModeButton.jpg" width=2% height=2% border=1>  </li>
<li> cut mode <img src="../../../images/cut.gif" width=2% height=2% border=1>  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> In particular, to create R(l,r,a) a tri-component molecule with no set states, each internal component is first drawn 
using the unbound component button.  Components in focus are blue in color, while the others shift to black.  Next, by 
changing to object manipulation mode, each component may be separately selected to bring up three options including 
<B> Rename</B>, <B> Delete </B> and <B> Binding </B>.  For R(l,r,a), the components are renamed as l, r, and a.  
</p>

<br>

<p> Using the Container button allows a container boundary to be dragged around the three components.  It may be easier 
to get the desired shape by first creating the container on a blank part of the Editor Window workspace and then reshaping 
and dragging on top of the components while in object manipulation mode.  The container can then be selected to bring up 
its options including <B> Rename</B>, <B> Delete </B> and <B> Create Molecule Type</B>.  The container is renamed R 
and then registered as a molecular pattern using these options.  Component state status will be automatically queried with 
Create Molecule Type to allow the addition of one or more states.   Once finished the <B> Done </B> button will add
these states to the molecule and then register it as a valid type.  For R(l,r,a) there are no set states, hence 
the selection of <B> Done </B> is simply chosen first off for each component that is presented.   
</p>

<br>

<p>
The molecular pattern defined by R(l,r,a) will then appear in the Molecule Template Palette.  The remaining molecule
types are created the same way.  Between each new molecule that is created and registered, it may be helpful to clear the 
Editor Window workspace by first selecting the old molecule and then deleting with the cut button.  Once a molecule type has 
been added to the Molecule Types Palette, its overall color will shift from red to green indicating the validity of the 
pattern.  As before, while working on the object as a whole, the blue focus color will override its previous color.
