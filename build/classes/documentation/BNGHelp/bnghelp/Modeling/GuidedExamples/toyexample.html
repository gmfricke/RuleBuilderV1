<p>
This chapter illustrates model creation and simulation for an exemplar model.  The exemplar describes the initial 
events of a signaling cascade that is initiated by ligand binding and aggregation of receptors.  It is based on a
full model of a monovalent extracellular ligand, a monovalent cell-surface receptor, a bivalent cytosolic adaptor
protein, and a cytosolic kinase.  The receptor dimerizes through a receptor-receptor interaction that depends on
ligand binding.  The adaptor binds the receptor and the kinase.  When two kinases are juxtaposed through binding to
receptor-associated adapter proteins, one of the kinases can transphosphorylate the second kinase.

Each step of model creation is shown including creation and registration of the molecular actors, species and their
use within reaction rules.  The remaining steps to specify simulation parameters, save user work and execute the
simulation follow.
