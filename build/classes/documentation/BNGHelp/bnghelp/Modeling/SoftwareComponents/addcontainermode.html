The Add Container Mode allows the user to create a molecule.  Once this mode has been selected one or
more containers may be added into the Editor Window as needed.  Each container has a resize handle that allows
its physical extent to be manipulated to an either smaller or larger shape, however to move a container to 
a new location from its creation site the user must switch to Object Manipulation Mode, select the container,
and relocate as desired.  If a container is created around one or more components that are already existing within 
the Editor Window, the components automatically become part of the container.  These graphical representations
map to the domains and molecules that a user would like to model in a reaction.
