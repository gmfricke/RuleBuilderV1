The Add Component Mode is used to create individual components within the Editor Window.
Components may be placed before or after creation of a container, but must eventually be
part of a container.  Graphically this is done by simply moving a component into the
desired existing container, or by drawing a container around an existing component.  
By default components are given the name c, which can be changed.
</p>

<p>
Unwanted components may be deleted while in this mode or Object Manipulation Mode
by simply hitting the cut button for a particular selected component.
