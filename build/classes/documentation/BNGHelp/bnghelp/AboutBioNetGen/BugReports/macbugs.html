<ul>
<li> A right click operation is executed by ctrl-click. </li>
<li> The drag and drop operation from the Editor Window to one of the Palette Windows displays a false window boundary.  This can
be ignored and has no internal effect. </li>
<li> A File Open selection for an existing input file defaults internally to a .xml extension.  The correct file extension of .bng
must be manually selected using the pull down box at the bottom of the file open window. </li>
</ul>

<p>
There are no other reported issues or bugs at this time.
